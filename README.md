# WordSearch

WordSearch was a simple project assigned for my 
Data Structures and Algorithims Class (CS 360) 
at the University of Alabama.

The WordSearch implements a Trie to solve a 
word search given a dictionary. It has been 
tested and can run on a 1000x1000 puzzle.

You can run the program with square word search
puzzle. Sample puzzles and dictionaries are 
provided in this repository.

To run the program, run `ant jar`, and then
use the syntax

```bash
$ java -jar WordSearch.jar <path to puzzle> <path to dictionary>
```
